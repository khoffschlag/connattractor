Hopfield networks can be trained to store a finite number of patterns (e.g. via Hebbian learning). During the training procedure, the weights of the Hopfield ANN are trained so that the stored patterns become stable attractor states of the network. Thus, when the trained network is presented partial or noisy variations of the stored patterns, it can effectively reconstruct the original pattern via an iterative relaxation procedure that converges to the attractor states.\n","key":"ExDHEHueGj"},{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"B","key":"BK6FWM61x9"}],"key":"zIoEk3DgLU"},{"type":"text","value":" We consider regions of the brain as nodes of a Hopfield network.
