Instead of training the Hopfield network to specific tasks, we use the set its weights empirically, with the interregional activity flow estimated via functional brain connectivity. Following form the strong analogies between the relaxation rule of Hopfield networks and the activity flow principle that links activity to connectivity in brain networks, we propose the constructed connectome-based Hopfield (CBH) network as a computational model for macro-scale brain dynamics.
