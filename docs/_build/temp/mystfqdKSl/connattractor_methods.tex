\subsubsection{Data}

We obtained functional MRI data from 7 different sources (Table~\ref{tab-samples}).
We included three resting state studies with healthy volunteers (study 1, study 2, study 3), one task-based study (study 4), 8 meta-analytic task-based activation patterns obtained from Neurosynth (study 5), and three additional resting state studies focusing on specific disease conditions. These include the \acrshort{abide} (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) study on Autism Spectrum Disorder (\acrshort{asd}, study 6, \cite{di2014autism}), the COBRE (Center for Biomedical Research Excellence) study on Schizophrenia (study 8, \citep{aine2017multimodal}) and data obtained from ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (\href{http://adni.loni.usc.edu}{adni.loni.usc.edu}) on Alzheimer's Disease (study 7, \citep{petersen2010alzheimer}).

Study 1 (n=41) was used to evaluate the ability of the proposed approach to reconstruct resting state brain activity. Study 2 and 3 (n = 48 and 29, respectively) served es replications studies for these analyses. Further details on study 1-3 are described in \cite{Spisak_2020}. The ability of the proposed approach to model task-based perturbation of brain dynamics was evaluated in Study 4, which consisted of 8 runs of nine task-based \acrshort{fmri} runs for each of the 33 healthy volunteers. In all runs, participants received heat pain stimulation. Each stimulus lasted 12.5 seconds, with 3-second ramp-up and 2-second ramp-down periods and 7.5 seconds at target temperature. Six levels of temperature were a\acrshort{dm}inistered to the participants (level 1: 44.3°C; level 2: 45.3°C; level 3: 46.3°C; level 4: 47.3°C; level 5: 48.3°C; level 6: 49.3°C). In this analysis we used run 1 (passive experience)  run 3 (down-regulation) and run 7 (up-regulation). Participants were asked to cognitively ``increase'' (regulate-up) or ``decrease'' (regulate-down) pain intensity. See \citet{woo2015distinct} for details.
To obtain \acrshort{fmri} activation maps for tasks other than pain, we used Neurosynth(\cite{Tor_D__2011}), a web-based platform for large-scale, automated synthesis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (\acrshort{fmri}) data. We performed 8 different coordinate-based meta-analyses with the terms "motor", "auditory", "visual", "face", "autobiographical", "theory mind", "language" and "pain" and obtained the z-scores maps from a two-way ANOVA, comparing the coordinates reported for studies with and without the term of interest, and testing for the presence of a non-zero association between term use and voxel activation. The meta-analyses encompassed a total  of 14371 different studies.

In study 6 and 7 (\acrshort{abide}, COBRE respectively), we obtained preprocessed regional timeseries data from the Preprocessed Connectome Project \citep{craddock2013towards}, as shared (\href{https://osf.io/hc4md}{https://osf.io/hc4md}) by \citet{dadi2019benchmarking}. Preprocessed regional timeseries data for study 8 (ADNI) was obtained from from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (\href{http://adni.loni.usc.edu}{adni.loni.usc.edu}). All preprocessed timeseries data were obtaoined with the 122-region version of the BASC (Bootstrap Analysis of Stable Clusters) brain atlas \citep{bellec2010multi}.

\subsubsection{Preprocessing and timeseries extractions}

Functional MRI data from studies 1-4 was preprocessed with our in-house analysis pipeline, called the RPN-pipeline (\href{https://github.com/spisakt/RPN-signature}{https://github.com/spisakt/RPN-signature}). The RPN-pipeline is based on PUMI (Neuroimaging Pipelines Using Modular workflow Integration, \href{https://github.com/pni-lab/PUMI}{https://github.com/pni-lab/PUMI}), a nipype-based \citep{gorgolewski2011nipype} workflow management system. It capitalizes on tools from FSL \citep{jenkinson2012fsl}, ANTS \citep{avants2011reproducible} and AFNI \citep{cox1996afni}, with code partially adapted from the software tools C-PAC \citep{craddock2013towards} and niworkflows \citep{esteban2019fmriprep}, as well as in-house python routines. We run the containerized version of the pipeline with default parameters, as in \cite{Spisak_2020}.

Brain extraction from both the anatomical and the structural images, as well, as tissue-segmentation from the anatomical images was performed with FSL bet and fast64. Anatomical images were linearly and non-linearly co-registered to the 1mm-resolution MNI152 standard brain template brain with ANTs (see \href{https://gist.github.com/spisakt/0caa7ec4bc18d3ed736d3a4e49da7415}{https://gist.github.com/spisakt/0caa7ec4bc18d3ed736d3a4e49da7415} for source code).

Functional images were co-registered to the anatomical images with the boundary-based registration technique of FSL flirt. All resulting transformations were saved for further use. The preprocessing of functional images happened in the native image space, without resampling. Realignment-based motion-correction was performed with FSL mcflirt. The resulting six head motion estimates (3 rotations, 3 translations), their squared versions, their derivates and the squared derivates (known as the Friston-24-expansion, \cite{friston1996movement}) was calculated and saved for nuisance correction. Additionally, head motion was summarized as framewise displacement (FD) timeseries, according to Power's method \citep{power2012spurious}, to be used in data censoring and exclusion. After motion-correction, outliers (e.g. motion spikes) in timeseries data were attenuated using AFNI despike. The union of the eroded white-matter maps and ventricle masks were transformed to the native functional space and used for extracting noise-signal for anatomical CompCor correction \citep{behzadi2007component}.

In a nuisance regression step, 6 CompCor parameters (the 6 first principal components of the noise-region timeseries), the Friston-24 motion parameters and the linear trend were removed from the timeseries data with a general linear model. On the residual data, temporal bandpass filtering was performed with AFNI's 3DBandpass to retain the 0.008--0.08\,Hz frequency band. To further attenuate the impact of motion artifacts, potentially motion-contaminated time-frames, defined by a conservative FD\,\textgreater \,0.15\,mm threshold, were dropped from the data (known as scrubbing, \cite{satterthwaite2013improved}). Participants were excluded from further analysis if more then 50\% of frames were scrubbed.

The 122-parcel version of the BASC multi-resolution functional brain atlas \citep{bellec2010multi} was individualized; it was transformed to the native functional space of each participant and masked by the  grey-matter mask obtained from the anatomical image, to retain grey-matter voxels only. Voxel-timeseries were averaged over these individualized BASC regions.

\subsubsection{Functional connectome}

Regional timeseries were ordered into large-scale functional modules (defined by the 7-parcel level of the BASC atlas) for visualization purposes.
Next, in all datasets, we estimated study-level mean connectivity matrices by regularized partial correlation, via the Graphical Lasso algorithm that estimates a sparse precision matrix by solving a Lasso problem and an L1 penalty for sparsity, as implemented in nilearn \citep{abraham2014machine}. Diagonal elements of the matrices were set to zero.

\subsubsection{Connectome-based Hopfield networks}

Hopfield networks, a type of artificial neural network, consist of a single layer of $m$ fully connected nodes \citep{hopfield1982neural}, with activations $\bold{a} = (a_1, \dots, a_m )$. Hopfield networks assign an energy to any arbitrary activity configurations:

\begin{equation}
\label{energy-function}
E = - \frac{1}{2}  \bold{a}^{T} \bold{W} \bold{a} + \bold{a}^{T}\bold{b}
\end{equation}

where $W$ is the weight matrix with element w\_\{i,j\} denoting the weight between nodes i and j and $\bold{b}$ is the bias, which is set to $\bold{b} = 0$ for all experiments.

During the so-called relaxation process, the activities of the nodes are iteratively updated until the network converges to a stable state, known as an attractor state. The dynamics of the network are governed by the equation referenced as eq (\ref{hopfield-update}), or in matrix form:

\begin{equation}
\label{hopfield-update-matrix}
\dot{\bold{a}} = S(\beta \bold{W} \bold{a} - \bold{b})
\end{equation}

where $\dot{\bold{a}} = (\dot{a}_1, \dots, \dot{a}_m)$ is the activity in the next iteration and $S(.)$ is the sigmoidal activation function ($S(a) = tanh(a)$ in our implementation) and $\beta$ is the temperature parameter.
During the stochastic relaxation procedure, we add weak Gaussian noise to each node's activity at every iteration:

\begin{equation}
\label{hopfield-update-matrix-stochastic}
\dot{\bold{a}} = S(\beta \bold{W} \bold{a} - \bold{b}  + \epsilon),
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu}, \sigma)$, with $\sigma$ regulating the amount of noise added and $\mathbf{\mu}$ set to 0, by default.

In this work we propose functional connectome-based Hopfield neural networks (fc\acrshort{hnn}s) as a model for large-scale brain dynamics. fc\acrshort{hnn}s are continuous-state Hopfield neural networks with each node representing a brain region and weights initialized with a group-level functional connectivity matrix. The weights are scaled to zero mean and unit standard deviation.

In studies 1-3, we obtained the finite number of attractor states for all fc\acrshort{hnn}s by repeate\acrshort{dl}y (100000-times) initializing the fc\acrshort{hnn} with random activations and relaxing them until convergence.

\subsubsection{fc\acrshort{hnn} projection}

We mapped out the fc\acrshort{hnn} state-space by initializing our fc\acrshort{hnn} model with a random input, and applying the stochastic update step for 100.000 iterations and storing all visited activity configurations.
We performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the state samples, and proposed the the first two principal  component (PCs) as the coordinate system for the fc\acrshort{hnn} projection. Using a Multinomial Logistic Regression, we predicted to which attractor state each of the state samples converges to, using the first two PCs as features. The model's performance was evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation. We visualized the attractor states position in the projection as well as the decision boundaries between the attractor states, based on this regression model. We set $\beta = 0.04$, which results in 4 attractor states given the connectome of study 1. We  generated fc\acrshort{hnn} projections in study 1 with four different {\textbackslash}sigma values (0.33, 0.35, 0.37, 0.39) and fixed $\sigma$ at 0.37 for all subsequent analyses. The value of $\sigma$ was selected based on visual inspection of the state space distribution and its similarity to real \acrshort{fmri} data in the fc\acrshort{hnn} projection (see Figure~\ref{rest-validity}).

\subsubsection{Replicability}

We obtained the four attractor states in study 1, as described above. We then constructed two other fc\acrshort{hnn}s, based on the study-mean functional connectome obtained in studies 2 and 3 and  obtained all attractor states of these models, with the same parameter settings ($\beta = 0.04$ and $\sigma = 0.37$) as in study 1. In both replications studies we found four attractor states. The spatial similarity of attractor states across studies was evaluated by Pearson's correlation coefficient.

\subsubsection{Evaluation: resting state dynamics}

Analogously to the methodology of the fc\acrshort{hnn} projection, we performed PCA on the preprocessed \acrshort{fmri} time-frames from study 1 (based on the regional timeseries data).
To compare the explanatory power of the first two PCs derived from fc\acrshort{hnn}-based simulated data and real \acrshort{fmri} data, we fit linear regression models which used the first two fc\acrshort{hnn} or real data-based PCs as regressors to reconstruct the real \acrshort{fmri} time-frames. In-sample explained variances and the corresponding confidence intervals were calculated for both models with bootstrapping (100 samples). To evaluate the out-of-sample generalization of the PCAs (fc\acrshort{hnn}- and real data-based) from study 1, we calculated how much variance they can explain in study 2.

To calculate fractional time occupancies of the attractor states in real timeseries vs simulated data, we used each real and simulated timeframe as an input to the fc\acrshort{hnn} of study 1 and obtained the corresponding attractor state. We performed a $\tilde{\chi}^2$ test on the resulting frequencies against the expected uniform frequencies.

\subsubsection{Evaluation: task-based dynamics}

We used study 4 to evaluate the ability of the fc\acrshort{hnn} approach to capture and predict task-induced alterations in large-scale brain dynamics.

First, runs 1, 3 and 7 from all participants, which investigated the passive experience and the down- and up-regulation of pain, respectively, was preprocessed with the same workflow used to preprocess studies 1-3. Regional timeseries data was grouped to "pain" and "rest" blocks, taking into account a 6-second delay to adjust for the hemodynamic response function. All activation timeframes were transformed to the fc\acrshort{hnn} projection plane obtained from study 1. Within-participant differences of the average location on the fc\acrshort{hnn} projection was calculated and visualized with radial plots, showing the participant-level trajectory on the projection plane from rest to pain, denoted with circles, as well as the group level trajectory (arrow). The significance of the position difference and energy difference of the participant-level mean activations in the projection plane was tested with a permutation test. We used the L2 norm of the two-dimensional position difference and the absolute energy difference, respectively, as test statistics. The permutation tests were run with 1000 permutations, randomly swapping the conditions.

To further highlight the difference between the task and rest conditions, streamplots were generated that visualize the dynamic trajectory of group-level activations.

First we calculated the direction in the projection plane between each successive TR during the rest conditions, resulting a vector on the fc\acrshort{hnn} projection plane for each TR transition.
Next, we obtained a two-dimensional binned means for both the x and y coordinates of these transition vectors (pooled across all participants), calculated over a total of 36 uniformly distributed bins.
The same procedure was repeated for the pain condition and the difference in direction between the two conditions was visualized as streamplots (using matplotlib).
We used the same approach the difference in characteristic state transition trajectories between the up- and downregulation conditions.

The empirically estimated trajectory differences were contrasted to the trajectory differences predicted by the fc\acrshort{hnn} model from study 1.
To obtain fc\acrshort{hnn}-simulated state transitions in resting conditions, we used the stochastic relaxation procedure ((\ref{hopfield-update-matrix-stochastic})), with $\mathbf{\mu}$ set zero.

To simulate the effect of pain-related activation on large-scale brain dynamics, we set $\mu_i$ during the stochastic relaxation procedure simulate pain-elicited activity in region i. The region-wise activations were obtained calculating the parcel-level mean activations from the meta-analytic pain activation map from \citep{zunhammer2021meta}, which contained Hedges' g effect sizes from an individual participant-level meta-analysis of 20 pain studies, encompassing a total of n=603 participants. The whole activation map was scaled with five different values ranging from 0.001 to 0.1, spaced logarithmically, to investigate various signal-to-noise scenarios.

We obtained the activity patterns of 100000 iterations from this stochastic relaxation procedure and calculated the state transition trajectories with the same approach used with the empirical data.

Next we calculated the the simulated difference between the rest and pain conditions and compared it to the actual difference through a permutation test with 1000 permutations, using the Spearman rank-ordered correlation coefficient as the test statistic.
From the five investigated signal-to-noise values, we chose the one that provided the highest similarity to the real pain vs. rest trajectory difference.

When comparing the simulated and real trajectory differences between pain up- and downregulation, we used the same procedure, with two differences. First, when calculating the simulated state transition vectors for the self-regulation conditions, we used the same procedure as for the pain condition, but introduced and additional signal in the nucleus accumbens, with a negative and positive sign, for  up- and downregulation, respectively.We did not optimize the signal-to-noise ratio for the nucleus accumbens signal but, instead, simply used the value optimized for the pain vs. rest contrast.

\subsubsection{Clinical data}

To demonstrate the sensitivity of the fc\acrshort{hnn} approach to clinically relevant alterations in large-scale brain dynamics, we investigated grouped the timeframes from the regional timeseries data according to the corresponding attractor states (obtained with the fc\acrshort{hnn} model from study 1) and averaged timeframes corresponding to the same attractor state to calculated participant-level mean attractor activations.
In all three datasets, we assessed mean attractor activity differences between the patient groups with a permutation test, randomly re-assigning the group labels 50000 times.
We adjusted the significance threshold with a bonferroni correction, accounting for tests across 4 states and 122 regions, resulting in $\alpha = 0.0001$.
